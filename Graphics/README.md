# Graphics — Short Program Overview

This folder contains small C/C++ graphics/demo programs. Below is a brief description of each file (short and inferred from filenames):

- `grid.cpp` — Draws or demonstrates a grid layout / grid-based graphics. Likely shows line drawing or tiled rendering.
- `minorII.cpp` — A minor project or demo (second version). Possibly a small graphics assignment or practice program.
- `ollee.cpp` — Short demo program (name suggests a small example or practice sketch); likely renders a shape or pattern.
- `star.cpp` — Draws a star or star-shaped pattern; likely uses simple graphics primitives to render a star.

How to run

- These are C/C++ source files. Compile with your compiler (e.g., `g++`) and run the produced executable. Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\tanis\Documents\VISUAL_STUDIO\git_repo\C-C-Programs-\Graphics"
# compile example
g++ grid.cpp -o grid.exe
# run
.\grid.exe
```

Notes

- The descriptions above are concise inferences from filenames. Open a source file to see exact behavior and dependencies (some programs may rely on graphics libraries or Windows BGI).
- If you want, I can add short one-line comments at the top of each file explaining exactly what each program does after inspecting the code.
